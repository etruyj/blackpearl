# BlackPearl JSON Objects

This package is a collection of Java classes for translating the json response for Spectra Logic's DS3_JAVA_CLI with Google's GSON class to allow for scripting interactions with Spectra Logic's BlackPearl. In order to use GSON's fromJson() function to translate the string, a structure must be defined as a template for the returned call. These classes form those templates.
Include these classes with import com.socialvagrancy.blackpearl.jsonObjects;
Spectra Logic's DS3_JAVA_CLI can be downloaded at developer.spectralogic.com.
Google's gson can be found on github under the google/gson repository.
