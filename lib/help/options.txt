BPCLI
	This script automates some actions with the BlackPearl through calls to Spectra Logic's DS3 JAVA CLI. The JAVA CLI needs to be downloaded from developer.spectralogic.com and the path to the /bin directory specified either in the config.yaml file or with the --ds3 flag. (REMEMBER to omit the final / on all directory path listings.). 

REQUIRES: JAVA 14 OR JAVA 15. This code requires Java 14+ to run. The JAVA CLI is coded at JAVA 8 and is no longer executable at JAVA 16+. 

Options:
	--access-key/-a		BlackPearl access key for the specified user.
	--bucket/-b		Bucket name.
	--debug			Same as --print ATM. May include deeper diagnostics at a future date.
	--ds3			Path to the /bin directory of the Java CLI application.
	--endpoint/-e		BlackPearl data IP address.
	--file-prefix		Prefix to be used when naming downloaded files (databases).
	--http			Use an insecure, non-SSL connection.
	--input-file		Path and name of the file holding list of tapes or objects.
	--max-moves/-m		The maximum number of moves the BlackPearl will make. Should equate to available EE slots. (--moves alos works)
	--output-path		Directory where process output should be stored. Includes CSVs of tape ejects or directory where databases will be stored. 
	--print			Messages are printed to the shell.
	--secret-key		BlackPearl secret key for the specified user.
